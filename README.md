# Final-Project
This E-commerce website project is done by the collaboration of passionate team members: -
Akin, Nosha, Swetha, Suji and Ashenafi.
This project was done during the first cohort of Java full stack development at Generation USA boot-camp in 2021. This project  will implement the use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create the front-end tasks, and Java to create backend tasks.
We will structure our E-commerce web page according to our initial designs and convert them to programming codes to apply all the needed functionality. For this work we have created this repository for our Front-End code (HTML + CSS + JavaScript). This private GitHub repository for our project that is shared with our instructor.
To give a run-down of our basic web structures, for example, The AboutUs Page contains: A short project description with Team profiles (short bio, photo and role in the project). We have used Bootstrap throughout our web pages. We will frequently update our pages by pushing to the repository to apply the code each participant created or updated and explanation is given on why the design was changed as project progress.
